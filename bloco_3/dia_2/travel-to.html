        Maldives, in full Republic of Maldives, also called Maldive Islands, independent island country in the <br>north-central Indian Ocean. It consists of a chain of about 1,200 small coral islands and sandbanks <br>(some 200 of which are inhabited), grouped in clusters, or atolls.<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The islands extend more than 510 miles (820 km) from north to south and 80 miles (130 km) from east to <br>west. The northernmost atoll is about 370 miles (600 km) south-southwest of the Indian mainland, and <br>the central area, including the capital island of Male (Maleâ€™), is about 400 miles (645 km) southwest of Sri Lanka.<br>
